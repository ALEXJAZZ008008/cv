        \item Project: Improved Quantification for Respiratory Gated PET/CT: Data-Driven Algorithms for Respiratory Motion Correction in PET/CT. This project was multifaceted, initially it began with the development of a respiratory motion correction method for PET/CT. This method was invariant of the position (and hence of the introduced bias) of a misaligned attenuation map. This was achieved through the use of an iterative method, which aligned PET data and moved its reference position to that of the attenuation map. To aid in this, motion models were incorporated, which can be considered as a temporal/gate regulariser. However, the project evolved to include methods to extract respiratory signals from dynamic PET data (for the use of gating and motion model estimation) as well as denoising and reconstruction techniques which use neural networks.

The goal of this project was the development of a library that could provide motion correction for PET using depth sensing cameras. Deformations were determined by registering depth images (point clouds) before spatially and temporally aligning them with the PET acquisition. These deformations could then be used to correct any motion present.

        \item Project: Capture the Campus!, this is a GPS based mobile game. The objective is to steer yourself around the periphery of a play area before then travelling across the play area all while avoiding multiple computer-controlled enemies. Once the player has crossed the play area it is then redefined as the larger of the two polygons created by splitting the area in two along the path travelled by the player. A score is awarded to the player based on the size of the polygon removed from the play area. If an enemy intersects the playerâ€™s path their path is reset and they lose some score. A local multiplayer session can be instantiated on one phone and joined by others running the application.

    \begin{rSection}{Personal Statement}
        I am currently a PhD student at University College London in medical physics. My PhD focuses, in particular, on respiratory motion correction (with the incorporation of motion models) for PET/CT. During my time as a PhD student I have also had an interest in surrogate signal extraction (specifically for dynamic PET) which lead to an exploration of machine learning/neural networks in general. I've applied machine learning to the fields of denoising, reconstruction and more recently arterial input function estimation.
        
        While studying for my PhD I undertook roles at the university teaching electronics, programming and communication. I specifically lead lectures for groups of approximately $200$ students, teaching the fundamentals of programming. Additionally, I have been the primary supervisor of one MSc dissertation and secondary supervisor of a further three. My primary supervision was on a project to apply machine learning to the extraction of respiratory signals from dynamic PET. My secondary supervision were on projects to denoise total body PET data using neural networks and 3D printed phantoms.
        
        Previously, I had studied at the University of Hull for an MSc and BSc in computer science. Here I had a particular interest in computer vision, compiler design and embedded programming. Larger projects I undertook included: A motion correction method for PET, which used a Microsoft Kinect camera to track and correct the motion of the patient in a medical scanner. As well as an online, multiplayer, mobile based game which saw players physically running around cities attempting to cut each other's path off, a la Tron.
        
        While studying for my MSc and BSc I undertook roles at the university which saw me performing research to produce a cave scanning device and an autonomous remote controlled race car. The cave scanning device consisted of a 3D printed custom mounted LiDAR atop a drone, which could fly into a cave and the LiDAR would scan. Furthermore I also taught classes on embedded and distributed programming.
        
        Other than for academic education and experience, I've also enjoyed positions in the past as a bouncer in the University of Hull's nightclub and as a helpful face moving first year students into their accommodation (helping them around the university in general). I was the social secretary of the University of Hull Computer Science Society and also an honorary member of the University of York's Real Ale Society (where I set many unbeaten records). Before Covid struck in full force, I also ran a cake club in the office where I was working on my PhD. Time permitting, I enjoy partaking in music (both attending and performing, I play the saxophone and the bass guitar - previously, I was involved in an outreach program teaching music in primary schools), analogue photography (and film development), 3D printing and beer brewing (I worked at York Brewery for a short time).
