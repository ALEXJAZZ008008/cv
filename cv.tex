        \item \begin{rSubsection}{University College London}{2022 - 2024}{Research Fellow}{}
            \item I worked at University College London from the winter of 2022 until the winter of 2024 as a research fellow. Here I was involved in multiple projects linked to OSIC (Open Source Imaging Consortium). One project was to develop a method (using neural networks) to predict how long a patient, suffering from IPF, might survive using a recent CT. I also developed an extension to this method which extracted maps of the patients lungs that highlighted regions causing the survival chance to decrease (similar to Grad-CAM but superior for our application). Furthermore, I was involved in a project to generate CTs of patients at later time points (using methods like diffusion) where their disease may have progressed. This final project was useful for disease management and planning.

            \item Project: Improved Quantification for Respiratory Gated PET/CT: Data-Driven Algorithms for Respiratory Motion Correction in PET/CT. This project was multifaceted, initially it began with the development of a respiratory motion correction method for PET/CT. This method was invariant of the position (and hence of the introduced bias) of a misaligned attenuation map. This was achieved through the use of an iterative method, which aligned PET data and moved its reference position to that of the attenuation map. To aid in this, motion models were incorporated, which can be considered as a temporal/gate regulariser. However, the project evolved to include methods to extract respiratory signals from dynamic PET data (for the use of gating and motion model estimation) as well as denoising and reconstruction techniques which use neural networks.

The goal of this project was the development of a library that could provide motion correction for PET using depth sensing cameras. Deformations were determined by registering depth images (point clouds) before spatially and temporally aligning them with the PET acquisition. These deformations could then be used to correct any motion present.

    \begin{rSection}{Personal Statement}
        \item I have most recently worked as a research fellow at University College London. My post doctoral position was in a different lab from my PhD and as such concentrated far more on principled machine learning (neural network) research. I was funded by OSIC and as such had access to their large database of IPF CT scans (and their relevant clinical data). As a group our objective was to determine novel biomarkers from this data, I specifically worked on survival analysis methods. We developed CenTime which is a novel censoring technique and improvement over both Cox (a very traditional survival analysis method) and DeepHit. I extended CenTime to produce maps of what in the CT is causing the greatest affect on the mortality of the patient. I also developed generative methods which could produce CTs of patients where their mortality is higher or lower. During my time in this position I was expected to present my work regularly at OSIC general meetings for experts in the medical imaging field.
        
        \item My PhD focuses, in particular, on respiratory motion correction (with the incorporation of motion models) for PET/CT. During my time as a PhD student I have also had an interest in surrogate signal extraction (specifically for dynamic PET) which led to an exploration of machine learning/neural networks in general. I've applied machine learning to the fields of denoising, reconstruction and more recently arterial input function estimation. My PhD office was in the university hospital and involved a great deal of collaboration with the clinical staff. I presented multiple times at conferences both as a poster presentation but also as an oral presentation. I was quite enthusiastic to submit to conferences and as such I often presented two or three pieces of work at each conference.
        
        \item While studying for my PhD I undertook roles at the university teaching electronics, programming and communication. I specifically led lectures for groups of approximately 200 students, teaching the fundamentals of programming. Additionally, I have been the primary supervisor of one MSc dissertation and secondary supervisor of a further three. My primary supervision was on a project to apply machine learning to the extraction of respiratory signals from dynamic PET. My secondary supervision were on projects to denoise total body PET data using neural networks and 3D printed phantoms.
        
        \item Previously, I had studied at the University of Hull for an MSc and BSc in computer science. Here I had a particular interest in computer vision, compiler design and embedded programming. Larger projects I undertook included: A motion correction method for PET, which used a Microsoft Kinect camera to track and correct the motion of the patient in a medical scanner. As well as an online, multiplayer, mobile based game which saw players physically running around cities attempting to cut each other's path off, a la Tron.
        
        \item While studying for my MSc and BSc I undertook roles at the university which saw me performing research to produce a cave scanning device and an autonomous remote controlled race car. The cave scanning device consisted of a 3D printed custom mounted LiDAR atop a drone, which could fly into a cave and the LiDAR would scan. Furthermore I also taught classes on embedded and distributed programming.
        
        \item Other than for academic education and experience, I've also enjoyed positions in the past as a bouncer in the University of Hull's nightclub and as a helpful face moving first year students into their accommodation (helping them around the university in general). I was the social secretary of the University of Hull Computer Science Society and also an honorary member of the University of York's Real Ale Society (where I set many unbeaten records). Before Covid, I also ran a cake club in the office where I was working on my PhD. Time permitting, I enjoy partaking in music (both attending and performing, I play the saxophone and the bass guitar - previously, I was involved in an outreach program teaching music in primary schools), analogue/digital photography (and film development), 3D printing, beer brewing (I worked at York Brewery for a short time), and fish keeping.
